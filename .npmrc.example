# NPM registry configuration (optional)
# Copy this file to .npmrc (or merge into your user ~/.npmrc) and adjust as needed.
# .npmrc is gitignored so your registry URL is never committed.

# Default: npm uses https://registry.npmjs.org/ when no .npmrc is present.
# To use a different registry, create .npmrc in this project with, e.g.:
# registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Then run: npm install

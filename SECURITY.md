# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Preferred**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for this repository. That allows us to work with you privately and credit you when we publish an advisory.

2. **Alternatively**: Open a new Security advisory in this repository (Security tab → Advisories → New draft).

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge your report and aim to respond within a reasonable time.
- We may ask for clarification or more details.
- We will keep you updated on the status and work with you on disclosure (e.g. after a fix is released).

Thank you for helping keep Markwell and its users safe.
